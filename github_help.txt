How to use GitHub - right?

1. You have to use a commander/terminal
	In Linux/Mac: terminal, cd / ls etc. commands
	In Windows: open start menu - start typing cmd - hit enter
2. Usefull commands:
	cd <path> - change directory
	ls - (just in Linux/Mac) listing files in the actual directory
	dir - (just in Windows) same as ls
	git clone <url> - Clone to your computer (actually to the directory where you call this) that repository which url you copied
					- If you have this, you can work on that project, and the git will follow your (and other's) changes.
	git status - only works in the repository directory. It will list the modifies you make
	git add <filename> - it will track the file to your repository
	git commit -m "Message text" - to commit your changes to the repository. Make sure, that you write a meaningfull message,
								 - so others will understand what the changes is!
	git push - this will upload your commits to the server, so others can download it! (only works in the repository directory!)
	
	git pull - to update your repository... (only works in the repository directory!)
	
	That's all...
	
So: 1. you clone a repository
	2. you make your own changes
	3. you can check status whenever you want
	4. add your files to track
	5. commit them with a message
	6. push them to the server so anyone can reach it
	
	if you have your repository just pull it down, not clone! It will update :)
	
	That's the very basic gitHub stuff, you have to know.
